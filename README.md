# OTF
Open Table Format (OTF) is a file format for storing tabular data that is easily accessible and interoperable across various data processing and analytics tools. In other words, a table format is a method of structuring a data set’s files to present them as a unified “table.”

Under this repository, I store assets (diagrams, infographics, etc.) that complement the posts I published about [OTF](https://celiamuriel.com/category/otf/) in [my blog](https://celiamuriel.com/).
